# Amphion Text-to-Speech (TTS) Recipe

## Supported Model Architectures

Until now, Amphion TTS supports the following models or architectures,
- **[FastSpeech2](FastSpeech2)**: A non-autoregressive TTS architecture that utilizes feed-forward Transformer blocks.
- **[VITS](VITS)**: An end-to-end TTS architecture that utilizes conditional variational autoencoder with adversarial learning
- **[NaturalSpeech2](NaturalSpeech2)** (üë®‚Äçüíª¬†developing): An architecture for TTS that utilizes a latent diffusion model to generate natural-sounding voices.
- **[Jets](Jets)**: An end-to-end TTS model that jointly trains FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN with an alignment module.
