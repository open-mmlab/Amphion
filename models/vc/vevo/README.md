We present our reproduction of [Vevo](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=anQDiQZhDP), a versatile zero-shot voice imitation framework with controllable timbre and style. We invite you to explore the [audio samples](https://versavoice.github.io/) to experience Vevo's capabilities firsthand.

We have included the following pre-trained Vevo models at Amphion:

- **Vevo-Timbre**: It can conduct *style-preserved* voice conversion.
- **Vevo-Style**: It can conduct style conversion, such as *accent conversion* and *emotion conversion*.
- **Vevo-Voice**: It can conduct *style-converted* voice conversion.
- **Vevo-TTS**: It can conduct *style and timbre controllable* TTS.

Besides, we also release the **content tokenizer** and **content-style tokenizer** proposed by Vevo. Notably, all these pre-trained models are trained on [Emilia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia-Dataset), containing 101k hours of speech data among six languages (English, Chinese, German, French, Japanese, and Korean).

## Quickstart

To run this model, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository and install the environment.
2. Run the inference script.

### Clone and Environment Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion.git
cd Amphion
```

#### 2. Install the environment

Before start installing, making sure you are under the `Amphion` directory. If not, use `cd` to enter.

Since we use `phonemizer` to convert text to phoneme, you need to install `espeak-ng` first. More details can be found [here](https://bootphon.github.io/phonemizer/install.html). Choose the correct installation command according to your operating system:

```bash
# For Debian-like distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)
sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
# For RedHat-like distribution (e.g. CentOS, Fedora, etc.) 
sudo yum install espeak-ng

# For Windows
# Please visit https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases to download .msi installer
```

Now, we are going to install the environment. It is recommended to use conda to configure:

```bash
conda create -n vevo python=3.10
conda activate vevo

pip install -r models/vc/vevo/requirements.txt
```

### Inference Script

```bash
# Vevo-Timbre
python -m models.vc.vevo.infer_vevotimbre

# Vevo-Style
python -m models.vc.vevo.infer_vevostyle

# Vevo-Voice
python -m models.vc.vevo.infer_vevovoice

# Vevo-TTS
python -m models.vc.vevo.infer_vevotts
```

Running this will automatically download the pretrained model from HuggingFace and start the inference process. The result audio is by default saved in `models/vc/vevo/wav/output*.wav`, you can change this in the scripts  `models/vc/vevo/infer_vevo*.py`
