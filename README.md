**Amphion (/√¶mÀàfa…™…ôn/) is a toolkit for Audio, Music, and Speech Generation.** Its purpose is to support reproducible research and help junior researchers and engineers get started in the field of audio, music, and speech generation research and development. Amphion offers a unique feature: **visualizations** of classic models or architectures. We believe that these visualizations are beneficial for junior researchers and engineers who wish to gain a better understanding of the model.

**The North-Star objective of Amphion is to offer a platform for studying the conversion of any inputs into audio.** Amphion is designed to support individual generation tasks, including but not limited to,

- **TTS**: Text to Speech (‚õ≥¬†supported)
- **SVS**: Singing Voice Synthesis (üë®‚Äçüíª¬†developing)
- **VC**: Voice Conversion (üë®‚Äçüíª¬†developing)
- **SVC**: Singing Voice Conversion (‚õ≥¬†supported)
- **TTA**: Text to Audio (‚õ≥¬†supported)
- **TTM**: Text to Music (üë®‚Äçüíª¬†developing)
- more‚Ä¶

In addition to the specific generation tasks, Amphion includes several **vocoders** and **evaluation metrics**. A vocoder is an important module for producing high-quality audio signals, while evaluation metrics are critical for ensuring consistent metrics in generation tasks. Moreover, Amphion is dedicated to advancing audio generation in real-world applications, such as building **large-scale datasets** for speech synthesis.

## üöÄ¬†News

## ‚≠ê¬†Key Features

### TTS: Text to Speech

- Amphion achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing open-source repositories on text-to-speech (TTS) systems. It supports the following models or architectures:
    - [FastSpeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558): A non-autoregressive TTS architecture that utilizes feed-forward Transformer blocks.
    - [VITS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06103): An end-to-end TTS architecture that utilizes conditional variational autoencoder with adversarial learning
    - [VALL-E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111): A zero-shot TTS architecture that uses a neural codec language model with discrete codes.
    - [NaturalSpeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09116): An architecture for TTS that utilizes a latent diffusion model to generate natural-sounding voices.
    - [Jets](Jets): An end-to-end TTS model that jointly trains FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN with an alignment module.
    - [MaskGCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00750): a fully non-autoregressive TTS architecture that eliminates the need for explicit alignment information between text and speech supervision.

### SVC: Singing Voice Conversion

- Ampion supports multiple content-based features from various pretrained models, including [WeNet](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet), [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), and [ContentVec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec). Their specific roles in SVC has been investigated in our SLT 2024 paper. [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Paper-<COLOR>.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11160) [![code](https://img.shields.io/badge/README-Code-red)](egs/svc/MultipleContentsSVC)
- Amphion implements several state-of-the-art model architectures, including diffusion-, transformer-, VAE- and flow-based models. The diffusion-based architecture uses [Bidirectional dilated CNN](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=a-xFK8Ymz5J) as a backend and supports several sampling algorithms such as [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf), [DDIM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02502.pdf), and [PNDM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09778.pdf). Additionally, it supports single-step inference based on the [Consistency Model](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=FmqFfMTNnv).

### TTA: Text to Audio

- Amphion supports the TTA with a latent diffusion model. It is designed like [AudioLDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12503), [Make-an-Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12661), and [AUDIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00830). It is also the official implementation of the text-to-audio generation part of our NeurIPS 2023 paper. [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Paper-<COLOR>.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00830) [![code](https://img.shields.io/badge/README-Code-red)](egs/tta/RECIPE.md)

### Vocoder

- Amphion supports various widely-used neural vocoders, including:
    - GAN-based vocoders: [MelGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06711), [HiFi-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646), [NSF-HiFiGAN](https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/project-NN-Pytorch-scripts), [BigVGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04658), [APNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07952).
    - Flow-based vocoders: [WaveGlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00002).
    - Diffusion-based vocoders: [Diffwave](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09761).
    - Auto-regressive based vocoders: [WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499), [WaveRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435v1).
- Amphion provides the official implementation of [Multi-Scale Constant-Q Transform Discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14957) (our ICASSP 2024 paper). It can be used to enhance any architecture GAN-based vocoders during training, and keep the inference stage (such as memory or speed) unchanged.

- **Energy Modeling**: Energy Root Mean Square Error, Energy Pearson Coefficients, etc.
- **Intelligibility**: Character/Word Error Rate, which can be calculated based on [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and more.
- **Spectrogram Distortion**: Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD), Multi-Resolution STFT Distance (MSTFT), Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), Short Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), etc.
- **Speaker Similarity**: Cosine similarity, which can be calculated based on [RawNet3](https://github.com/Jungjee/RawNet), [Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer), [WeSpeaker](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wespeaker), [WavLM](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/wavlm) and more.

The supported dataset list can be seen [here](egs/datasets/README.md) (updating). 
- Amphion (exclusively) supports the [**Emilia**](preprocessors/Emilia/README.md) dataset and its preprocessing pipeline **Emilia-Pipe** for in-the-wild speech data!

### Visualization

Amphion provides visualization tools to interactively illustrate the internal processing mechanism of classic models. This provides an invaluable resource for educational purposes and for facilitating understandable research.

Currently, Amphion supports [SingVisio](egs/visualization/SingVisio/README.md), a visualization tool of the diffusion model for singing voice conversion.
